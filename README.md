# A-Dictionary-in-Python
A program in Python to find the meaning of the word from the Data set.
In this program, all that we are doing is asking the user for a word and giving the meaning of the word.
Just like a Disctionary.


## Getting Started 
Using the command line we input the word.
The word can be in capital or small or a mixture of both the cases.
The program accepts all the cases.
Also if the word is incorrect, the program first searches for a word which is close to the input word and asks the user if he meant that word.If yes then it gives the meaning of that word.
If the word is not found in the dataset , then it displays a message that no word is found.
